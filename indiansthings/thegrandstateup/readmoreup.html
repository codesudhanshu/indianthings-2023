      <h2>About Uttar Pradesh</h2><br>
      <p>Uttar Pradesh has the largest population of nearly 167 million. Its is also the fifth largest state in terms of land area. The western plain is the most urban region. Agriculture is the most important section of the UP<sup>'</sup>s economy, employing about three-fourths of the work force. Uttar Pradesh has the largest production of food grain and oil seeds in India. In addition, UP ranks the first in the production of wheat, maize, barley, gram, sugar cane, and potatoes. The three most important industries of UP are sugar, cotton fabrics and diversified food preparations. Goods carrier equipment, photostat machines, chemicals, polyester fiber and steel tube galvanized sheets are the other big industries of UP.</p>

        <p>The Kathak dance style, the most popular classical dance form in India, is nourished in UP. Today, foreign countries have also learned this elegant dance form to perfection: the beautiful Veronique Azan as an example. The countryside songs and dances are significant traits of local culture. Uttar Pradesh is famous for handicrafts such as carpet weaving, hand printing, chikan (a type of embroidery), metal enameling, brocade and brass, and ebony work. UP also has the biggest brass and copperware manufacture area in India.</p>
        
        <p>The history of the State of Uttar Pradesh is very ancient and interesting. It is recognised in the later Vedic Age as Brahmarshi Desha, or Madhya Desha. Many great sages of the Vedic times like Bharadwaja, Gautam, Yagyavalkya, Vasishta, Vishwamitra and Valmiki flourished in this state. Several sacred books of the Aryans were also composed here. Two great epics of India, Ramayana and Mahabharata, appear to have been inspired by Uttar Pradesh.</p>

        <p>Uttar Pradesh preserved its intellectual excellency even under the British administration. The British combined Agra and Oudh into one province, and called it United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. The name was shortened to the United Provinces in 1935. In January 1950, the United Provinces was renamed as Uttar Pradesh.</p>

         <p></p>   The state is bounded by the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh as well as Nepal in the north, Haryana in the west, Madhya Pradesh in the south, and Bihar in the east. Uttar Pradesh can be divided into two distinct regions, (i) Southern hills and (ii) Gangetic plain.</p>

        <h1>Get in</h1><hr>
        <h3>By Road</h3><br>
         <p>Uttar Pradesh is one place with risky drivers having no understanding of the lanes on the road whatsoever. You can, however, still find very decent drivers amongst such a mess. The only way to glide through swiftly amidst the intense network of roads of Uttar Pradesh is if you have an experienced driver with a lot of patience. There are many local cab providers in the area and many big brands like Ola and Uber too, however, it is advised that a tourist traveling here for the first time should take a pre-booked cab rather than trusting a local driver you just met.</p>

         <p>Not to be scared, the roads of Uttar Pradesh will not be your worst experience in India. But a little precaution and investment will leave you beautiful memories of a lifetime.</p>
